# Canteen Approval Workflow Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
Implemented a complete approval workflow where new canteens must be approved by admin before they appear in the student dashboard.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Canteen Registration Changes**

#### Backend: `backend/routes/auth.js`
- ✅ Removed auto-activation on registration
- ✅ New canteens now start with:
  - `approvalStatus: 'pending'`
  - `status: 'inactive'`
- ✅ Updated success message: "Your registration is pending admin approval"
- ✅ Added `pendingApproval: true` flag in response

#### Backend: `backend/models/Canteen.js`
- ✅ Changed `status` default from `'active'` → `'inactive'`
- ✅ Kept `approvalStatus` default as `'pending'`

**Result**: New canteens are now inactive and pending until admin approves them.

---

### 2. **Student Canteen List Filtering**

#### Backend: `backend/routes/canteen.js`
- ✅ Updated `/active` endpoint to filter by:
  ```javascript
  {
    status: 'active',
    approvalStatus: 'approved'  // NEW: Only admin-approved canteens
  }
  ```
- ✅ Added console logging for debugging

**Result**: Students only see canteens that are both active AND approved by admin.

---

### 3. **Canteen Dashboard Notifications**

#### Frontend: `frontend/src/pages/canteen/CanteenDashboard.js`
- ✅ Updated profile fetch to include `approvalStatus`
- ✅ Added **Pending Approval Warning Banner** (Yellow):
  - Shows when `approvalStatus === 'pending'`
  - Message: "Your canteen registration is awaiting admin approval. You won't be visible to students until approved."
  
- ✅ Added **Rejected Status Warning Banner** (Red):
  - Shows when `approvalStatus === 'rejected'`
  - Message: "Your canteen registration has been rejected by the admin."

**Result**: Canteens are immediately notified of their approval status.

---

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Canteen Registration
```
1. New canteen registers via /canteen/register
2. System creates canteen with:
   - approvalStatus: 'pending'
   - status: 'inactive'
3. Canteen receives token and success message
4. Can login but sees "Pending Approval" warning
```

### Step 2: Admin Reviews
```
1. Admin sees new canteen in "Pending" filter
2. Admin can:
   - ✅ Approve → Sets approvalStatus: 'approved' + status: 'active'
   - ❌ Reject → Sets approvalStatus: 'rejected'
   - ⏸️ Suspend → Sets status: 'inactive'
```

### Step 3: Post-Approval
```
✅ If Approved:
   - Canteen becomes visible to students
   - Warning banner disappears
   - Canteen can accept orders

❌ If Rejected:
   - Canteen sees rejection warning
   - Still not visible to students
   - Cannot accept orders
```

## 📊 Current Approval Statuses

### Canteen Model States:

| approvalStatus | status    | Visible to Students? | Can Accept Orders? |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| `pending`      | `inactive`| ❌ No               | ❌ No             |
| `approved`     | `active`  | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes            |
| `approved`     | `inactive`| ❌ No               | ❌ No             |
| `rejected`     | `inactive`| ❌ No               | ❌ No             |

## 🎨 UI/UX Updates

### Canteen Dashboard:
1. **Pending Approval Banner** (Yellow)
   - Icon: Warning triangle
   - Clear message about waiting for approval
   - Visible until approved

2. **Rejected Banner** (Red)
   - Icon: X circle
   - Message about rejection
   - Instruction to contact support

### Student Dashboard:
- Only shows approved canteens
- Pending canteens are completely hidden
- No UI changes needed (handled by backend filtering)

---

## 🔧 Admin Panel Integration

The existing admin panel already has full canteen approval functionality:

### Admin Can:
1. **View All Canteens** with filters:
   - All
   - Pending (needs approval)
   - Approved
   - Rejected

2. **Approve Canteen**:
   - Sets `approvalStatus: 'approved'`
   - Sets `status: 'active'`
   - Records `approvedBy` and `approvedAt`

3. **Reject Canteen**:
   - Sets `approvalStatus: 'rejected'`
   - Can add rejection reason
   - Canteen receives rejection message

4. **Suspend/Unsuspend**:
   - Toggle `status` between 'active'/'inactive'
   - Even approved canteens can be temporarily suspended

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **Token Generation**: Canteens receive auth token even when pending
   - Allows them to login and see their status
   - Cannot accept orders until approved

2. **API Protection**: 
   - Students can only fetch approved canteens
   - Menu items of pending canteens are not accessible

3. **Admin Controls**:
   - Only admins can approve/reject
   - All approval actions are logged

---
